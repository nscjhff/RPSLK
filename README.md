This is a game of RPSLK, created as a class project. 
Coded in Java.  

(Rules of RPSLK: http://www.samkass.com/theories/RPSSL.html)  

This program allows the user to play with an Opponent with a simple AI. 
The AI allows the opponent to detect the Player's throwing pattern
  (if the user throws according to one of the 5 pre-existing throwing patterns), 
  and makes its throws accordingly, to maximize the Opponent's wins.  
  
For testing purposes, the Player can be automated to throw according to any of the 5 pre-existing throwing patterns.  

The pre-existing throwing patterns are: 
  repeater (rr) makes the same throw every round, 
  rotator (ro) rotates through the 5 throwing options, 
  reflector (rl) throws what the player has thrown in the previous round, 
  repeater (rz) throws randomly, and 
  mixer (mr) randomly selects a different throwing method for every given number of rounds.
